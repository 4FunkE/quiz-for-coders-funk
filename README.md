# FunkE Coding Quiz

## Description

This website is for beginner coders looking to test their knowledge. The quiz consists of 5 simple questions. The quiz is timed and will test you knowledge against the time and questions answered. I am motivated to help fellow coders quiz themselves for practice. I learned how to use javascript and used prior knowledge of css and html to create the web page.
